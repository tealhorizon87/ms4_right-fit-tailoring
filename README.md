### Design
This application is an e-commerce store utilising the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework for functionality, and [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for payment processing. The site is useable by both registered and unregistered users, with certain features only available to registered users. Functionality for the site is broken into several apps:

#### Home
  - The home app contains functionality for the home page, namely rendering the home page to users when they enter the site.

#### Products
  - The products app contains functionality concerning the products and how they are displayed to the user and the administrator. This app also contains the form for admin to add, edit or delete items from the site and all the functionality for the made to measure section as well.

#### Profiles
  - The profiles app displays the user's profile page once they have registered, the saved delivery and measurement details, and a list of the previous orders of the user. This app also contains the function to delete the user's profile when they wish it.

#### Cart
  - The cart app concerns itself with displaying the shopping cart to the user and the functionality for adding and removing items to the cart.

#### Checkout
  - The checkout app contains the forms and models required to create an order, both to be displayed to the user and to the administrator, all the stripe functionality to process payment and systems to protect that function.

#### Wish list
  - The wish list app allows users to set up multiple wish lists, add and remove items to said wish lists, and display them back to the user.

2. You should now have a copy of the repository on your account

### Making a Local Clone
1. From the repository home page, select the 'code' tab (next to the green 'Gitpod' button)
2. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
3. Open Git Bash
4. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
5. Type 'git clone', and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2.
6. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
7. Alternatively, you can use 'Open with GitHub Desktop' and follow the instructions, or just download the ZIP file containing the code files
